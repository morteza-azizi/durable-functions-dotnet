# Inventory Processing System - Azure Durable Functions

## Architecture Overview

This solution demonstrates an enterprise-grade event processing system using Azure Durable Functions to handle inventory events in a reliable, scalable manner. The system processes batches of inventory events, ensuring exactly-once processing and transaction integrity.

## Key Architectural Patterns

- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Processing inventory events asynchronously
- **Orchestrator Pattern**: Coordinating multiple steps in a business process
- **Entity Pattern**: Maintaining stateful entities for transaction tracking
- **Fan-out/Fan-in Pattern**: Handling multiple parallel work items
- **Idempotency**: Ensuring operations can be safely retried

## Technical Components

1. **Starter Function**: HTTP-triggered entry point that initiates orchestrations
2. **Orchestrator Function**: Coordinates the processing workflow
3. **Entity Function**: Maintains state for transaction processing
4. **Activity Functions**: Perform actual work (IO-bound operations)

## Solution Benefits

- **Reliability**: Automatic checkpointing ensures process resumption after failures
- **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling with Azure Functions consumption plan
- **Observability**: End-to-end tracing of inventory transactions
- **Cost-efficiency**: Serverless model with pay-per-execution pricing

## Implementation Details

The solution handles multi-message transactions by:
1. Creating a unique correlation ID for each batch
2. Processing each event in the context of its transaction
3. Detecting when all events in a transaction are processed
4. Consolidating data and performing final actions (e.g., file upload)

## Deployment Considerations

- Regional deployment for data residency requirements
- Appropriate configuration of host.json for performance tuning
- Integration with monitoring systems for operational visibility
